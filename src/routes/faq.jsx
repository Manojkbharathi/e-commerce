          <h3>What is Contactless Delivery?</h3>
          <p>
            Contactless Delivery means that there will be no direct contact
            between customer and delivery rider. Meal will be placed in a
            pre-agreed location and avoid touching or close face to face
            contact.
          </p>
          <h3>How to do I avail contactless delivery?</h3>
          <p>
            Please opt for ‘Contactless delivery’ while placing your order
            online (web/m-site/app). Sometimes, our rider will also get in touch
            with you to understand where the pizza needs to be placed.
          </p>
          <h3>Can I do Cash-on-delivery for contactless delivery?</h3>
          <p>
            No, you cannot opt for cash-on-delivery. Since we are trying to make
            this entire process contactless, cash-on-delivery in this case will
            not be possible.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Do I have to pay extra to avail the contactless delivery service?
          </h3>
          <p>
            No, you don’t have to pay extra to avail the contactless delivery
            service.
          </p>
          <h3>Can I get all pizzas and other products at all stores?</h3>
          <p>
            The menu is displayed as per the availability of the menu items in
            the respective restaurant. In case certain menu items are not listed
            in the menu page, that restaurant is not serving those items. In
            case of non-availability of ordered product at a particular
            restaurant, the order will not be fulfilled. The restaurant will
            inform you of the same
